Used-Car-Price-Predictor

This project focuses on building a used car price prediction platform that helps users estimate fair selling prices based on real-world factors such as car specifications, ownership history, vehicle condition, maintenance details, location, and current market trends. The goal is to reduce confusion and price manipulation commonly seen in the automobile resale market by providing data-driven price insights.

Why This Project Matters: 
Used car pricing is often inconsistent and influenced by negotiation, incomplete information, or dealer bias. This platform brings transparency to the process by using machine learning to generate objective price estimates. It empowers buyers and sellers to make informed decisions, builds trust, and saves time during negotiations.

Key Features:
Machine learning–based price prediction using XGBoost,
Car price comparison to evaluate market fairness,
Interactive market analysis for trend insights,
Contact interface to connect buyers and sellers.

Benefits 
Improves pricing accuracy and fairness,
Reduces chances of overpricing or underpricing,
Enhances user confidence and trust,
Scalable for real-world deployment.

Tools & Technologies: Python, XGBoost, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
